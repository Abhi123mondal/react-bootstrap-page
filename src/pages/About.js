<h2>WHAT IS VIRGIN MOJITO</h2>
<p>Most of you may have heard of cocktail Mojito which is an alcohol based drink made of mint leaves, lemon juice and sweetened with sugar. The non-alcoholic version of this drink is known as Virgin Mojito. The base ingredients remain the same that is mint leaves and lemon juice but the alcohol gets replaced with a bubbling drink like club soda, sprite or simply sparkling water.

The combination of flavors from the tangy lime, the sweetness from sugar syrup and the freshness from mint is ultimate game changer. Just One sip...and you will know what I'm saying. If you haven't tried this drink yet you are surely missing out.

Let's see how to make this easy and refreshing virgin mojito recipe at home. </p>

 




<p>HOW TO MAKE VIRGIN MOJITO:
It is very easy to make the virgin mojito recipe. All you need to do is in a tall serving glass add the lime juice, simple syrup, half of the lime slices and mint leaves.  Muddle/crush these using the muddler (or use back of the large wooden spoon) for 10 seconds or so such that the mint releases its essential oils. Don't over do it as it will make the mint taste bitter and your drink may taste unpleasant.


Now fill your glass with ice and top with your choice of bubbling drink like club soda, sparkling water, sprite or ginger ale. Garnish with lemon slices and mint leaves and serve immediately. 

You can make simple syrup ahead (boil equal parts water and sugar until dissolved) of time and refrigerate. Make the drink just before serving since the key to this recipe is its freshness!! 

That's it, our refreshing non-alcoholic mocktail Virgin Mojito is ready! Serve it fresh and chilled. Enjoy!
