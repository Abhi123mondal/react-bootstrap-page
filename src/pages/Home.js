        <h1>MASALA SODA</h1>
        <p>Summers and a glass of masala soda, I can’t even tell you how perfect this combination is! A glass of this chilled Indian soft drink will definitely provide you instant relief from that scorching heat outside.

Those of you who don’t know what is masala soda? Well, it is carbonated lime and mint flavored soft drink that comes together in just 5 minutes.

Tangy and sweet in taste, this has become a family favorite, whenever we need a refreshing and yummy drink during summers.

I feel this is also a great drink to serve to your guests instead of serving a hot cup of tea and coffee in the summers. And I am sure your guests will just love it.

Nowadays, you even get a pre-made masala soda powder, so in case you want something even more quickly you can get one of those, but believe me, there is nothing more refreshing than making it from scratch with fresh ingredients.</p>
<p>Mint Leaves – Use fresh mint leaves for the best taste.

Lime Juice – I would suggest you use freshly squeezed lime juice. You can add the bottled lime juice, but the fresh ones give a better taste.

Ginger – Ginger adds a nice peppery taste to this drink. In case you do not have fresh ginger, you can just add in a little ginger powder instead.

Sugar – Adjust the sugar as per your taste. You can increase or decrease the quantity of sugar depending upon how sweet you want the soda to be.

Soda – Add in a little soda water for that fizz.



Seasonings – To add up a little more tangy spicy flavor, add in chaat masala powder, black salt, black pepper powder, and roasted cumin powder. You can adjust the quantity of these spice powders to suit your taste.

Variations – Add some kokum juice while making the soda. You can also add in coco cola, 7-up, or sprite instead of soda water.</p>
