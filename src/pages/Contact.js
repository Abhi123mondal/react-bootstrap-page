        <p>Blue lagoon mocktail drink recipe – How many times it has been that you come from scorching heat and all you crave is something cold, or its an event at home and you have easily sorted out all the alcoholic drinks, but for those who don’t consume alcohol, you feel that there is not much to be offered. I have had this scenario a few times and every time I serve some or the other mocktail, which not only is great to drink, also makes your ‘non-alcohol’ consuming guests equally welcome.

This is a very colorful and refreshing mocktail that can make any party interesting. It has sweet sour to taste and the sprite in it adds to the flavour. Of course you can add vodka or rum to make blue lagoon cocktail.

Stir lightly with a spoon and garnish with lemon wedges or any other gently bitter product, such as lime.
Using shaker
Take a shaker and add blue curaçao syrup, simple sugar syrup and lemon juice to it. Now add ice and couple of lemon wedges (optional), give a good shake until its well chilled.
Transfer the contents to a glass and top up with lemonade, soda, garnish and serve.
How to make best mocktail
If you want a restaurant-quality drink, get king size ice moulds so the ice doesn’t melt and dilute your drink. A pro tip is to fill the moulds with boiling water before freezing it. This will remove air from the water resulting in maximum chill.
When shaking your mocktail in shaker, make sure you put in a bit of elbow grease to blend the ingredients well.
Adding a bitter to the dish, gives a professional edge. By this I imply that you add bitterness to the rim of glass or on top of drink. In simplest form, I will say add bitter lime.
The colder your mocktail is, the better it would taste, hence keep your glassware in the freezer for a minimum of 30 minutes before pouring in your drink.
Look at the expiry dates of all the ingredients from blue curaçao syrup, sugar syrup, to lemonade. Expired ingredients will easily spoil the taste and not good for health as well.
Do not compromise on garnishing, it is not only for presentation but it also adds flavour and aroma to the cocktail. The general rule of citrus includes wedges, wheels, twists and peels. In this mocktail, you can use lemon, lime or orange slices.
When using shaker, make sure that the shaker lid is properly sealed, before shaking, I have managed to do disaster of flipping the contents in the air more than once.
Serving Suggestion
Serve this mocktail freshly made in a cold glass with lots of ice with lemon wedges or orange slices. Do not forget to pair your drink with right nibbles.

Alcoholic version
For the alcoholic version of this blue lagoon, add 40 ml of vodka instead of soda in the recipe and add in the shaker, subsequently give a nice shake. This way your blue lagoon cocktail is ready in few minutes.</p>
